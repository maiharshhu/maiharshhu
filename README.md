# Hi — I’m Harsh Jain 👋

Aspiring **MERN stack developer** currently learning **React** and building practical projects to strengthen my frontend and full-stack skills.

---

## 🔭 About Me

* I'm passionate about building clean, scalable web applications.
* Currently focused on mastering **React (hooks, state management, routing)** and connecting it to Node/Express backends with MongoDB.
* I enjoy reading docs, following best practices, and turning theoretical knowledge into working projects.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React (Hooks, Context, Router)

**Backend:** Node.js, Express

**Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)

**Other:** Git, GitHub, REST APIs, Postman, Vite / Create React App

---

## 🎯 Current Learning Focus

1. **React** — Functional components, `useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks, performance optimizations, component patterns.
2. **State Management** — Context API and patterns; exploring Redux / Zustand basics.
3. **API Integration** — Building RESTful APIs with Node + Express and integrating them with React.
4. **Authentication** — JWT-based auth and protected routes.
5. **Deployment** — Deploying full-stack apps (Vercel / Netlify for frontend, Heroku / Render / Railway for backend).

---

## 🚧 Projects (Work in Progress / Ideas)

* **TodoApp (React + Node + MongoDB)** — CRUD, auth, protected routes.
* **E‑Commerce Mock** — Product listing, cart, checkout (frontend-first, then connect to backend).
* **Blog Platform** — Rich text editor, user posts, comments, and user profiles.

> *Each project is a learning milestone — small, focused, and production-ready (responsive + accessible).*

---

## 📚 Roadmap (Short-term)

* Build at least 2 full-stack projects end-to-end and deploy them.
* Learn testing basics (Jest + React Testing Library) for components and API endpoints.
* Improve CSS skills: responsive design, Flexbox, Grid, and component-level styling.

---

## ✅ What I'm Looking For

* Open-source opportunities to contribute and learn.
* Code reviews and mentorship to improve architecture and best practices.
* Internship / junior developer roles where I can grow into a reliable MERN developer.
